The '''wagtails''' form the [[passerine]] [[bird]] genus ''Motacilla''. They  are small birds with long tails which they wag frequently. '''''Motacilla''''', the root of the [[family]] and [[genus]] name, means ''moving tail''. The [[Forest Wagtail]] belongs to the [[monotypic]] genus ''Dendronanthus'' which is closely related to ''Motacilla'' and sometimes included herein.

The [[Willie Wagtail]] (''Rhipidura leucophrys'') of [[Australia]] is an unrelated bird similar in colouration and shape to the [[Japanese Wagtail]]. It belongs to the [[fantail|fantail flycatcher]]s.
